🛒 E-Commerce Sales Insights Dashboard using Python

This project performs an end-to-end Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA) on an E-Commerce dataset to uncover patterns, trends, and actionable business insights.
Using Python, Pandas, NumPy, Matplotlib, Seaborn, and Plotly, the notebook visualizes KPIs such as sales, profit, customer behavior, and product performance.

⭐ Project Goals

• Identify top-performing product categories and sub-categories.
• Analyze state and regional contributions to overall sales and profit.
• Understand monthly and yearly sales trends.
• Determine whether higher discounts reduce profitability.
• Evaluate performance across customer segments.
• Highlight top customers and best-selling products.
• Compare sales and profit across shipping modes.

📌 Key Insights :

• Sales and Profit are uneven across states, with a few states contributing the majority of revenue.
• Technology and Office Supplies categories show strong sales performance.
• Some sub-categories generate high sales but low or negative profit due to heavy discounting.
• Higher discounts generally reduce profit margins, indicating poor discount strategy.
• Consumer segment performs the best in both sales and order volume.
• Shipping mode usage varies, but Standard Class is the most commonly selected option.
• Top customers and products follow a Pareto pattern, where a smaller percentage contributes heavily to total sales.
